Shortcuts 
Possibly some of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts ever are CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y | CMD+Z 
or CMD+Y. Z stands for undo and Y for redo. Both operate on multiple levels, meaning that you can 
go back in time a long way. As always there are of course exceptions to the rule and some actions 
cannot be undone. In some of these cases, Excel will give you a warning (e.g., deleting a worksheet 
that has content in it, cannot be undone and Excel will warn you about this) and then there are other 
events that you cannot undo and no warning message is displayed (e.g. using the 'Move Chart' tool - 
more on this in Week 6). 
CTRL-Y will redo your most recent action which comes in really handy if/when you want to apply a 
certain step more than once.  
New File/ New Workbook 
To create a new workbook or new file, you do not need to go into any menu's. You can simply press: 
CTRL+N | CMD+N 
Open file / Open Workbook 
To open the dialogue box and select an existing file (workbook) you can use the shortcut: CTRL+O | 
CMD+O 
Close file / Close Workbook 
To close your current Workbook, you can click on the 'x' located at the top right (Windows) or top left 
(Mac), But as shortcut keys are sometimes quicker, you can press: CTRL+W | CMD+W 
Save file / Save Workbook  
Saving your work regularly should become second nature. This shortcut will help. If you haven't 
saved your file beforehand, Excel will ask you to assign a name and storage location to your file. If 
you have, this shortcut will quickly save your file. CTRL+S | CMD+S 
Select all 
The select all shortcut actually behaves differently based on context. If you are in an empty cell and 
select all, you will select the entire worksheet. If the active cell contains data that is part of a group 
(cells containing contiguous data) select all will just select the group of cells instead. You can press it 
again to select the entire worksheet. The shortcut for select all is: CTRL+A | CMD+A) 
Enter a new line of Text 
Sometimes when entering data into a cell, you may want to go to a new line below your current one, 
within the same cell. Rather than let Excel choose when this happens you can use this key press 
combination to force this behaviour. When editing a cell, press: ALT + Enter 
Moving around the worksheet 
You can use the arrow keys to move a single cell in any direction. Page Up and Page Down will move 
one "page" (the number of rows shown on the screen) up or down. CTRL+arrow keys will move to 
the next blank cell in that direction. If you have a large dataset with no gaps this will move to the 
edges of the dataset. CTRL+Home takes you to the first cell that contains data in the top-left corner 
of the sheet. CTRL+End goes to the last cell in the bottom-right. On certain keyboards without a 
Home key, you might need to use CTRL+Fn+Home to use this shortcut. 
Using the keyboard can make your work faster and smoother.
